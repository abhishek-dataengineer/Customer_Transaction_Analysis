How to Present This in an Interview
-----------------------------------
When asked about your SQL skills, you can say:

In my recent project, I worked on analyzing customer transactions using PostgreSQL. I started with basic queries for revenue tracking and customer behavior analysis. 
Then, I incorporated subqueries and window functions to rank customers, analyze purchase frequency, and track retention trends. 
Additionally, I used CTEs and LAG/LEAD functions to compare monthly revenue changes and identify customer inactivity patterns. 
This project helped me gain a deep understanding of SQL for business intelligence and analytics."
